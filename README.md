# 💬 Sentiment Analyzer Dashboard

An **AI-powered dashboard** that analyzes comments and classifies them into:  
- 😊 Positive  
- 😡 Negative  
- 😐 Neutral  

Built with **Streamlit + Machine Learning**, this project helps organizations (like government bodies, companies, or NGOs) quickly understand public sentiment from feedback or survey responses.

## 📖 Project Description
Feedback analysis is time-consuming when done manually.  
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automatically detect the **mood** of comments.  

👉 Example:  
- "This scheme is very helpful" → 😊 Positive  
- "The policy is useless" → 😡 Negative  
- "The meeting was held on Monday" → 😐 Neutral  

The dashboard provides both **individual comment analysis** and **bulk file analysis**, with beautiful **charts** and **word clouds** for easy understanding.

## 🎯 Project Vision
Our vision is to create a **smart sentiment analysis tool** that can:  
- ✅ Help government ministries analyze **citizen feedback** in large volumes.  
- ✅ Allow companies to understand **customer satisfaction** instantly.  
- ✅ Be used in surveys, reviews, and consultations for **faster decision-making**.
